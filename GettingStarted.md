GT Impact is a pack by 4gname and sportacus, made for both Russian and English players.  

This guide has been written by Chezzik in hopes that players after him will not be as confused as he was!  It is for v1.0.2.2, before quests were added to the pack.  Once quests are added, this guide will likely be redundant.

## Very early game

 * Punch trees with fists for wood.  A crafting table is made with 4 logs.
 * Harvest 20+ gravel, then place and break repeatedly until you have a decent supply of flint.
 * Look at flint recipes (press 'u' while mousing over flint).  Make an axe and knife, and others if you can.

## Finding a good spot for a very early temporary base

 * For very early game, you will want a good supply of gravel.  The base of many hills/mountains have large amounts of gravel, so I've found this to be the most important factor.
 * Sheep and cows are needed in rather high numbers early, so find a base spot with some close by, and keep those alive.
 * It will be a while before you have buckets, so a spot near a natural lake or river is good for early wheat farms. If your lake is up high, then you can channel water down the side and support crops on the hillside.

## Considerations for a permanent base

 * Savannas and deserts are great because they have no rain (which can cause machines to explode)
 * Wet biomes are important because early water production scales to the humidity of the biome.  Oceans and rivers are best, with swamps being a close second.
 * An ideal location could be a savanna on the bank of a river.  You can place your steam production in the river biome, and pipe the steam to your nice dry base in the savanna.

## Early exploration

 * Start as a nomad and just explore for a while.  Scout out spots that could work for temporary and for permanent bases.
 * By default in single player, you have access to 100 homes.  Use /sethome <homename> for any locations you want to return to
 * Slaughter cows that you find and shear sheep (using your GT knife).  You'll probably need to raise these animals later, but if you are exploring anyway, you may as well get these resources.
 * Harvest gravel that is easily accessible and convert to flint.  If you can gather 2-3 stacks of flint now, then that will get you mostly through the early game.
 * Gather seeds and sugarcane.  You'll need these eventually.
 * Harvest rubber trees you find.  Sticky resin + sticks will be your main source of early torches.
 * Find and mark a desert, so you can return later for sand.  Harvest any clay you find now.
 * Find 2 yellow and 2 red flowers.  You'll need the dye for your hologram projector.
 
## Setting up a temporary base

The goal of this base is to get steel.  Once you have steel, you will likely want to move to a more permanent base.

### Things to make immediately:

 * Farm: You can right click on mature wheat to harvest it and replant.
 * Animals: Fences in Impact are expensive early, and are a bit derpy (it's 1.7.10), so I usually start with just 2-deep holes in the ground.  I use one for cows, and one for sheep.
 * String - made with knife & wool in crafting grid
 * Forge Hammer & Lumberaxe - needs string, but are powerful flint tools.
 * Drying racks - needed for bound leather
 * 5 tanned leather (4 for mill rotor and 1 for the mill)
 * Hologram Projector - needed for seeing multiblock structures 
 * vanilla chests & furnaces.  Logs can be used for fuel, I tend to use rubber wood when I have it.

### Understanding the Forge hammer
 * Right click on the ground to change modes.  One mode gives flint, the other gives ores
 * Left clicking mines a 3x3 area
 * 72 durability is used with every block broken
 * Flint version breaks 400 blocks
 * Bronze and iron versions break 1200 and 1600 blocks (respectively)
 * Metallic stone dust can be processed into Fe, Tn, Cu, and Pb
 * Mineral stone dust is a source of gypsum and calcite
 * Coal-sulfur stone dust is a source of coal and sulfur.

## Building the Mill

[![Image of starter base](https://i.imgur.com/Crt18ZJ.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/Crt18ZJ.jpg)

The Mill is the first multiblock you will make.  In addition to the controllar (called "The Mill"), you will also need a mill rotor and 262 mill wood planks.  7 ladders will be very useful in accessing the control block, so plan for them as well.

### The controller:
 * Needs to be 9 blocks above the ground.  Make a pillar 8 blocks up from a flat area, and place the controller on top.
 * Can be broken safely with an axe.  The tooltip says a wrench is needed, but fortunately an axe works as well.
 * Right click the controller with the hologram projector to see the rest of the multiblock.  The projection goes away on its own after about a minute.

### The rotor:
 * Shift click the front of the controller with the rotor to place the rotor.  This has to be the last step, so if your multiblock doesn't form, you may need to break the rotor (with an axe) and place again.
 * The Rotor needs a 13x13x2 area.  Place 3 blocks of dirt in front of the controller, then stand on the one furthest away, break the other 2, then place the rotor.
  
Once the multiblock is complete, place a ladder on the inside so you can get to the controller.  Make a soft mallet (6 planks + a stick) and whack the controller to turn it on.  

### Once you get your first metal:

 * dirty metal dusts can be smelted in a vanilla furnace.
 * dirty coal and lignite coal can be used as fuel
 * Smelt some cobblestone (any type) to get stone, then use with ingots to make mortars
 * Mortar + ingots in a crafting grid makes metal dust.  Tin + copper dust makes bronze dust.
 * Make GT tools (hammer, file, wrench, etc) from either bronze or iron
 * Optionally make metal forge hammers.  It takes 24 iron ingots to make one hammer, and it will give you in return ~40 metal dusts of each type, which is almost enough to make 2 bronze forge hammers and 2 iron forge hammers.
 * Barrels are available now, and are a good way to store your cobblestone
 
## Coke Oven
 * Make a rolling pin.
 * Cultivate sugarcane, use it to make chad, and then paper.
 * Make a wooden brick form.
 * Make several Coke Oven controllers and the full multiblocks.  They can share walls.
 * Make hoppers to insert to the input bus.
 * Output bus will automatically push to a chest.
 * Keep running at all times to make charcoal (or coal coke later).
 * Break and replace the hatch when it fills with creosote.
 
## Bricked Blast Furnace
 * Harvest a ton of clay, and make compressed fireclay.
 * Make your bricked blast furnace.
 * Use to make either wrought iron (nuggets only) or your first steel.

Congrats!  You have made your first steel, which is the focal point of this guide!

If you have played Gregtech before, you should be well-suited for the rest of the pack. But it's worth pointing out the first few steps after you have made your first steel.

## After you have steel:
 * Move to a more permanent base
 * Primitive Water Pump
 * Boilers
 * Steam-powered machines
 * Coal Miner
 * Circuits, and finally LV!
